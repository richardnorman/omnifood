# omnifood
This was a project that I made when completing a great course that went in depth into HTML and CSS. Omnifood is a dummy website that demonstrates skill in HTML, CSS, and jQuery. The site is responsive, optimized for performance and has some cool visual effects <a href="https://richardnorman.github.io/omnifood/">Click here to view the website!</a>
